# Code Refactor

We were to refactor the code for the webpage without changing its appearance.

## Description

I went through both the index.html and style.css and:
- looked for non-semantic elements.  Those were updated.
- looked for places where there was redundant code (like in the css). Those were consolidated.
- changed the order of some elements in the css so that they flow with the order of elements on the html.
- updated the copyright year.
